# Heart Disease Prediction System  

Heart disease prevention has become more critical than ever. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve research and prevention efforts, allowing more people to lead healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning (ML) plays a significant role. ML helps in predicting heart diseases with high accuracy.

## ðŸ”¹ Steps to Predict Heart Disease  
1. Understanding the Problem  
2. Reading and Understanding the Data  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization  
4. Modeling  
5. Generating Insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
In this project, we analyze heart disease data to uncover insights and develop different ML models, including:  
1. Naive Bayes  
2.Logistic Regression  
3. Decision Tree  
4. Random Forest
5. KNN Model 

The goal is to predict heart disease risk based on relevant features.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of **14 features**:  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **age** | Age in years |
| **sex** | Sex (1 = Male, 0 = Female) |
| **cp** | Chest pain type: <br> 0 = Typical Angina <br> 1 = Atypical Angina <br> 2 = Non-anginal Pain <br> 3 = Asymptomatic |
| **trestbps** | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) |
| **chol** | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| **fbs** | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False) |
| **restecg** | Resting ECG results: <br> 0 = Normal <br> 1 = ST-T wave abnormality <br> 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy |
| **thalach** | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| **exang** | Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **oldpeak** | ST depression induced by exercise |
| **slope** | Slope of peak exercise ST segment: <br> 0 = Upsloping <br> 1 = Flat <br> 2 = Downsloping |
| **ca** | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| **thal** | Thalassemia: <br> 0 = Normal <br> 1 = Fixed defect <br> 2 = Reversible defect |
| **condition** | Target variable: <br> 0 = No Disease <br> 1 = Disease |

## ðŸš€ Results  
After training all models, the **Random Forest model** was selected as the best model with an **accuracy of 96.18%**.
